Body :

STOP D.I.Y!
START D.I.T.
Yes, we want to do it.
Doing it includes yourself but not only
Come on, You don't want to be just with Yourself.
Do you?
Do not alone!
"Do it yourself" doesn't exclude you from already made products.
"Do it yourself" is another way of capitalisation.
"Do it yourself!" is now a guiltfully, exclusive insult.
This is an accusation: You are the only one in charge. 
There is you, the you that is doing it and there is also what is done by you.
This is the sommet of the do-it-ocracy.
Do it yourself is not only what's made by recycled, inventive object re-enactment. Today it's also a super high technology.
Do it yourself is a 102 years old thing.
Do it yourself is a military deviation into the concept of autonomy and responsibility.
Do you do it yourself because you don't want to share, to ask, to be disrupted, contredit, 
SO
DO IT TOGETHER.
This is the moto of this early century. 
This is the basement for the shapes we want to create.
